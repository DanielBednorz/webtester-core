# Internet Explorer Browser Factory
The module `webtester-support-ie` provides a default `BrowserFactory` implementation called `InternetExplorerFactory`.

## Additional Service Executable
The 'InternetExplorerDriver' needs an additional executable to communicate with a IE browser.
It can be downloaded [here](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html).

The path to the executable must be declared as a system or environment property named: `webdriver.ie.driver`
